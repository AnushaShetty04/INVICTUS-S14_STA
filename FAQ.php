  <p>Always choose sanitary products with an absorbency level that’s appropriate for your menstrual flow. Changing these products less frequently than once in four to eight hours (four hours for pads and four to eight hours for tampons) may lead to bacterial growth and infections.</p>

  Can you bathe while on your period?

  <p>Yes, people who are menstruating can safely take baths. Normally, running water is perfectly fine. But if you have any reproductive health problems, it’s a good idea to consult a health care provider before soaking in the tub. If you do choose to take a bath while on your period, follow these steps for the safest experience:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ensure the bathtub is clean, as your immune system is more susceptible to infection during menstruation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use warm water — not hot. Hot water may provoke heavier bleeding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash your genitals before sitting in the tub (for example, rinse off under the shower).
          </li>
  </ul></p>

  If you use a pad for the night and sleep for about eight hours, should you get up every four hours to change it?
</button>
</h2>
<div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
<div class="accordion-body">
  <p>When you’re active during the day, your menstrual flow is normally heavier, so the pad absorbs more blood, sweat, and sebum. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria, which is why you shouldn’t wear one pad for more than four hours.
When you are asleep, your bodily functions slow down, and the bleeding intensity decreases, so you can safely wear a pad overnight. However, don’t use tampons for more than eight hours. They’re associated with a risk of toxic shock syndrome, a severe infection.</p>
